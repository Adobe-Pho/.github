## What is Adobe Photoshop?

**Adobe Photoshop** is the world’s most advanced and widely used software for **raster graphics editing**, digital painting, photo retouching, and graphic design. Since its initial release, Photoshop has set the industry standard for creative professionals, including photographers, illustrators, designers, and digital artists. With its comprehensive suite of tools, it allows users to manipulate images, create stunning visual compositions, and bring imaginative concepts to life.

Photoshop supports a non-destructive workflow through features like **layers, masks, adjustment layers, and smart objects**. This enables artists to experiment freely without permanently altering the original image. The software also includes powerful retouching tools, advanced brush engines, and support for a wide range of file formats.

Whether you're restoring old photographs, designing web layouts, creating digital art, or preparing images for print, Adobe Photoshop offers the precision, flexibility, and control needed to achieve professional results. Its integration with other Adobe Creative Cloud apps like Illustrator, Lightroom, and Premiere Pro makes it an essential part of any creative workflow.
